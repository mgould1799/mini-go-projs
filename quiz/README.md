This is a quick project that creates a quizi program that runs in the CLI. It takes in a CSV with the format of `problem,answer`.

To run the program, create the binary with `go build`, and the output should be `quiz`. Once that is done, run the binary with `quiz -csv=<some csv file>.csv`. An example format of the csv file has been provided.
